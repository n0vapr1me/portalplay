<h1> Hello my name is Fredrick Ny </h1>
<p>I am a full stack developer living in Long Beach, California </p>
<p>I like to solve puzzles or even play games like Tetris and Settlers of Catan</p>
<p> As a gamer, I'd like to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create designs similar to Cyberpunk for that Retro look </li>
    <li>Working with others to complete the task or mission</li>
    <li>To master decoding front and back</li>
</ul>

 <h2 class ="border-top">About Fredrick</h2>   
 <p> I went to California State University Northridge (CSUN), with a degree in BioTechnology. Before I decided to try and get my masters to do medical research, I wanted to see if patient care was something I might like to do in the future rather than research. However covid took a big hit and I wanted to see if coding would be more stress free compared to working in the Emergency Room</p>
 <p> Besides coding, I like to venture out to unknown places just to explore and appreciate natural beauty. Like hiking but stopping every 15 minutes to look at something instead of going the distance.</p>
 <p> To relieve stress, playing video games can only do 15 minutes of justice since I rather work out to feel better mentally and physically.</p>
